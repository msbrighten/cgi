there have many details before running the EFSDAF that can make EFSDAF run successfully.

(1) The content of the provided csv file is the pop of endmembers that have three endmembers based on the landsat images. 
therefore, the bands of the input landsat images are four bands at least. i recommand using six bands for landsat images to execute EFSDAF.

(2) The valuse of the all bands should be corrected to 0-1, and the resolution of modis images should be resampled to 30m as same as landsat images.

the provided images are corrected to execute EFSDAF directly.


(3) The program is written in IDL; IDL and ENVI are required

(4) Before running the program, build a new IDL project , copy all the files to the project folder

(5) before Compiling and executing the EFSDAF program, you should create a cache file on your  disk. like, "d:/temp". 
then, set the parameters of efsdaf according to your research areas and content.

Attention: （1） the EFSDAF don't support the single band input, such as NDVI.

(2) the efficiency of the EFSDAF is relatively low, it is not recommended for a wide range of  applications now.
